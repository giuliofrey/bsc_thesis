This is the repository for the Undergraduate Thesis of Giulio Frey. We want to analyse how connected are different public housing with essential services around the
city of Milan. 

## Data sources

We use datasets provided by the portal [Open Data Comune di Milano](https://dati.comune.milano.it/) in order to track essential services. 

A record of Social Housing in the city of Milan provides physical addresses. It can be found [here](https://casa.mmspa.eu/wps/portal/pon/case/home/patrimonio/alloggi/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zifQ0sjdwtTIx83f0NzQ0c_SzcDEKCfIz8_c30w1EVWHiYGRkEeod5-AUEBxkYOhvrRxGj3wAHcDQgTj8eBVH4jQ_Xj8JnhYW3OboCC3N3oM6w4GBD08BAAzc3YwwFmGFAyBUFuaGhEQaZnumOiooA8-SPZw!!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/)
